# Rossmann Sales Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the daily sales of Rossmann drug stores using historical sales data. Rossmann operates over 3,000 stores across 7 European countries, and accurate sales forecasts are crucial for effective store management. The provided dataset includes information on promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality.

## Problem Statement
Given the historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores, our task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. Some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment, which adds an additional challenge to the prediction.

## Data
The dataset contains the following features:
- Store ID
- Date
- Store type
- Assortment type
- Competition distance
- Promo (promotion) status
- School and state holidays
- Day of the week
- Seasonality factors

## Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the data distribution, identify missing values, and explore relationships between features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create relevant features such as lagged sales, rolling averages, and holiday indicators.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate regression models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods).
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train the selected models on the training data and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
6. **Prediction**: Apply the trained model to predict sales for the test set.
